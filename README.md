## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to the "Forecasting Economic and Market Regimes" project. The primary objective of this project is to forecast economic regimes, with a specific focus on predicting recessions. The core significance of this endeavor lies in its potential impact on the field of asset management, particularly in catering to the needs of long-term investment strategies. However, the benefits of these predictive models extend beyond the realm of asset management. Other stakeholders, including policymakers, business executives, and individuals, can also leverage these insights for their own purposes. Policymakers can devise proactive measures to mitigate the impact of economic downturns, executives can make informed decisions to guide their businesses through challenging times, and individuals can take preemptive actions to safeguard their financial stability. In the latter phase of the project, we broaden our scope to encompass the prediction of market crash regimes, as well.


## **2. Methodology**

In this project, we navigate our journey through a structured and time-tested methodology. Our chosen guide is the **[CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-modeler/saas?topic=dm-crisp-help-overview)** framework—an adept and versatile approach that crafts a methodical roadmap for data-centric ventures. This established methodology ensures that our analysis is not only comprehensive and insightful but also harmoniously aligned with our overarching business goals.

The CRISP-DM methodology encompasses the following cardinal phases:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment (Please note: The deployment stage remains outside the scope of this project, as we are focused on presenting data science insights rather than operational deployment.)


## **3. Dataset Information**

Here's a concise overview of the datasets we've used in our project:

- **FRED-MD Dataset for Features**: We've harnessed the FRED-MD (Federal Reserve Economic Data - Macroeconomic Database) to extract a comprehensive set of macroeconomic variables. These variables capture the intricacies of economic conditions, enhancing the accuracy of our analyses.

- **NBER Business Cycles Dating for Economic Regime Labels**: Our economic regime labels are derived from the NBER business cycles dating dataset. This authoritative source provides precise indications of economic expansion and recession periods, forming a solid foundation for our predictive models.

- **𝓁1-Trend-Filtering Technique for Market Regime Labels**: To label market regimes, we've employed the 𝓁1-trend-filtering technique.

All datasets underwent meticulous preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and alignment, ensuring the reliability of our analyses. For detailed preprocessing and utilization specifics, consult the individual notebooks and analysis files within the repository.


## **4. Selected Results**

In the process of model selection for predicting economic regimes, XGBoost outperformed other competitors examined in the project. Here are the selected results and visualizations for predicting economic regimes with a horizon of one month ahead:

In the above figure, you can explore the confusion matrix generated by the XGBoost model for predicting economic regimes. This visualization offers a comprehensive overview of the model's performance in distinguishing between normal economic periods and recessionary phases.
